Compile:
Must have visual studio 2019 installed.
Change the program location in build.bat to match your VS install directory

In CMD (just the normal cmd) navigate to the "tracker_driver" directory
run `build`
copy the "AzureTracker" directory that's inside "build" to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers"
